Here I made the spring boot application. 

1) FirstPro :  This Project For Just simple code of the spring boot.

2) WebApplication : This Project I have done the code of dependancy injection.In which by default created package com.row_star.demo package which have one class by default and Two                     another class made by self.One that is Alien and seconde is homeController.
                    1)Alien : Alien class have three varible these are id , name of the alien , technology. we use one annotation that is @Component
                    2)homeController : this class work as controller. in which we mapping the request with any html or jsp , etc.. pages.I used the home request mapping with                             home.jsp as well as I used the ModelAndView object for response. this object also used for passing the parameter with url.
